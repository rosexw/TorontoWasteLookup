# Toronto Waste Lookup
A web app that users can search for waste items using the Toronto Waste Wizard database, and save frequently used ones.

## App is Live

## Search for any item in the Toronto Waste Wizard Lookup table
Use the search function to find where you should put the item. Press enter or select the search button to start the search. This performs an API call that searches data from [Waste Wizard Lookup data (JSON)](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#5ed40494-a290-7807-d5da-09ab6a56fca2). The results display the disposal bin category and description.

## Clear the results
When the search input field is cleared, the list of results are cleared.

## Favourite any result
The favourited result has a green star next to it and is added into the favourites list.

## Unfavourite any result
This result is removed from the favourites list and now has a grey star next to it.
